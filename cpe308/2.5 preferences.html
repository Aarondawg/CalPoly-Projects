<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2.5 Preferences<BR>	The preferences tab
currently supports two main functions, editing preferences for
individual professors as well as editing preferences for specific
classes. These professor preferences can range from teaching at
certain times to certain classes they wish to teach. The class
preferences help decide when a class will take place and prevent
certain classes from taking place at the same time.<BR>	(a) Professor
Preferences<BR>		This option window has a very simple layout. The
user selects the professor whose preferences they wish to edit from
the list on the side of the window. Once a professor is selected, the
user can simply check or uncheck certain preferences such as certain
times of the day they wish to teach, specific days of the week they
prefer to teach, as well as which classes they would like to
teach.<BR>	(b) Class Preferences<BR>		This window is very similar to
the professor preferences menu. The user first selects a class from
the list on the side of the window, then edits certain
preferences/constraints for a specific class. These options include:
what days of the week the class will be, what time the class will be
taught, and how long the class will be. The user can also choose
which classes should not be at the same time as the selected class
from a list on the side.</P>
