        <h2>2.6 Preferences</h2>
        
        <p>The preferences menu currently allows the user to access preference windows for individual professors and classes. These professor preferences can range from teaching at certain times to certain classes they wish to teach. The class preferences help shape when a class will take place and prevent certain classes from taking place at the same time. To access these menus the user simply clicks the name of the menu on the drop down box.</p>

            <h3>2.6.1 Professor Preferences</h3>
            <p>This option window has a very simple layout. The user selects the professor whose preferences they wish to edit from the list on the side of the window. Once a professor is selected, all of their current preferences will appear and the user can simply check or uncheck certain preferences such as certain times of the day they wish to teach, specific days of the week they prefer to teach, as well as which classes they would like to teach. When any of the preferences are changed, it is automatically saved so the user does not have to remember to save these changes.</p>

            <h3>2.6.2 Class Preferences</h3>
            <p>This window is very similar to the professor preferences menu. The user first selects a class from the list on the side of the window. After a class is selected, all of the current preferences and constraints for said class will appear. The user then edits certain preferences/constraints for a that class by checking or unchecking the available options. These options include: what days of the week the class will be, what time the class will be taught, and how long the class will be. The user can also choose which classes should not be at the same time as the selected class from a list on the side. The user does not have to worry about saving these changes because it will be done automatically when any preference is changed.</p>
