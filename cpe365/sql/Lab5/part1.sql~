SELECT rname, type, price

WHERE iname = 'egg'
ORDER BY rname ASC;

-- 7b
SELECT r.rname, type, price
FROM recipe r
WHERE rname NOT IN (
    SELECT c.rname
    FROM contains c
    WHERE iname = 'egg')
ORDER BY r.rname;

-- 7c
SELECT r.rname, type, price
FROM recipe r
WHERE 'egg' NOT IN (
    SELECT iname
    FROM contains c
    WHERE c.rname = r.rname)
ORDER BY r.rname;

-- 7d
SELECT r.rname, type, price
FROM recipe r
WHERE 'egg' <> ALL (
    SELECT iname
    FROM contains c
    where c.rname = r.rname)
ORDER BY rname;

-- 7e
SELECT r.rname, type, price
FROM recipe r
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM contains c
    where c.rname = r.rname and iname = 'egg')
ORDER BY rname;

-- 8. List the rname and price of the recipes with the highest price by using a sub-select in the WHERE clause that generates the highest price of all recipes. Output in increasing order or rname
SELECT x.rname, x.price
FROM recipe x
WHERE x.price = (
    SELECT max(r.price)
    FROM recipe r
    )
ORDER BY x.rname;

-- 9. SAME AS 8 BUT WITH ANY/ALL
SELECT r.rname, r.price
FROM recipe r
WHERE r.price >= ALL (
    SELECT x.price
    FROM recipe x)
ORDER BY r.rname;

-- 10. List the rname of each recipe that has the highest ingredient cost
SELECT rname
FROM contains INNER JOIN ingredient USING (iname)
GROUP BY rname
HAVING sum(cost*amount) =
   (SELECT MAX(sum(cost*amount))

    GROUP BY rname
   );
