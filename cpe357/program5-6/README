things to know: our cd executes correctly, but the next command afterward doesn't, it's like the path isn't right,
any command afterward works fine, so cd .., then ls, will error, but if you ls again, it works fine...which is weird

also, ctrl C will kill the shell, a little conditional we forgot to add and I just realized without enough time to fix.
